# bubblequalia-ontological

Ontological Bubble Qualia Framework — for breath, life, and constitutional healing.

## ✊ Purpose

This repository encodes the principle that:

- **Breathing is not optional.**
- **Survival is not optional.**
- **Work is optional.**
- **No Biafran child must ever die again.**

It is a living archive of **OBINexus ontology research**, constitutional computing, and the spirit of the masquerade — rebuilding sovereignty from fracture, blood, sweat, and tears.

## 🌍 Vision

- To heal fragmented ecosystems through **breath-first governance**.
- To ensure **life before labour**, dignity before bureaucracy.
- To encode **Igbo constitutional tiers (Tier3A, TierB)** into technical artifacts that protect human rights.
- To transcend oppression and depression cycles with **equitable, neurodivergent-first frameworks**.

## 🌀 Principles

- **Breath Dance**: Every cycle begins with breath, the rhythm of life.
- **OBI Nexus**: Heart, soul, and connection — UCHE (wisdom), EZE (power), OBI (spirit).
- **Auraseal Initiative**: Healing continues with us all, butterflies on the battlefield.
- **Constitutional Computing**: Fail-safe systems where governance is human-centric, equity-based, and antifragile.
